 'status': 'success'}

---

### 2. **Core Functionalities**

#### 2.1 Data Download and Management

- **Data Source:** Use OpenAlgo Python API client to fetch historical stock data.
- **Download Modes:**
    - Fresh download: Download full historical data for selected symbols and date ranges.
    - Incremental update: Continue downloading new data from last checkpoint to keep database current.
- **Date Ranges:** Support predefined ranges (today, last 5 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years).
- **Batch Processing:** Process symbols in configurable batches with retry and error logging.
- **Checkpointing:** Track last successfully downloaded symbol and timestamp for resuming interrupted downloads.
- **Data Storage:**
    - Store all OHLCV data directly into SQLite tables.
    - Use a unified table schema for all symbols with columns: SYMBOL, DATE, TIME, OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME.
    - Implement upsert logic to avoid duplicate records during incremental updates.
    - No CSV files are saved or used as intermediate storage.


#### 2.2 Watchlist Management

- Allow users to create and manage a dynamic watchlist of stock symbols.
- Persist watchlist data in SQLite to maintain state across sessions.
- Support adding/removing symbols with immediate UI updates and smooth animations.
- Display real-time quotes for all watchlist symbols, updating automatically.


#### 2.3 Data Visualization

- Integrate TradingView Lightweight Charts for interactive data visualization.
- Support multiple timeframes: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly.
- Enable auto-update of charts for real-time data monitoring.
- Provide chart features such as zoom, pan, tooltips, and markers.
- Allow users to select symbols and timeframes for visualization from the watchlist.
- Use Python libraries (e.g., lightweight-charts-python) for seamless integration with Flask backend and frontend.

---

### 3. **User Interface Requirements**

- Responsive web UI built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components.
- Clean and intuitive layout with:
    - Symbol selection and watchlist management panel.
    - Date range and timeframe selectors for data download and charting.
    - Download progress and status indicators.
    - Interactive chart display area with TradingView charts.
- Real-time feedback on data download status and errors.
- Smooth animations for watchlist updates.

---

### 4. **Data Model**

**SQLite Database Schema:**


| Table Name | Columns | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| stock_data | id (PK), symbol (TEXT), date (DATE), time (TIME), open (REAL), high (REAL), low (REAL), close (REAL), volume (INTEGER) | Stores OHLCV data for all symbols |
| watchlist | id (PK), symbol (TEXT UNIQUE), added_on (DATETIME) | Stores user’s watchlist symbols |
| checkpoints | id (PK), symbol (TEXT), last_downloaded_date (DATE), last_downloaded_time (TIME) | Tracks last downloaded data points |

- Indexes on (symbol, date, time) for efficient querying.

---

### 5. **API Endpoints**

| Endpoint | Method | Parameters | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/api/symbols` | GET | None | Returns list of available symbols |
| `/api/download` | POST | symbols[], start_date, end_date, mode (fresh/continue) | Triggers data download and storage |
| `/api/watchlist` | GET/POST/DELETE | symbol (for POST/DELETE) | Manage watchlist symbols |
| `/api/data` | GET | symbol, start_date, end_date, timeframe | Fetch OHLCV data for chart visualization |
| `/api/quotes` | GET | symbols[] | Fetch real-time quotes for watchlist symbols |


---

### 6. **TradingView Chart Integration Features**

- **Data Input:** Feed OHLCV data from SQLite via backend API to TradingView charts.
- **Timeframes Supported:** 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d, 1w, 1mo.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Auto-refresh chart data at user-configurable intervals.
- **Watchlist Sync:** Selecting a symbol from the watchlist updates the chart instantly.
- **Chart Features:** Zoom, pan, tooltips, markers, multi-pane support.
- **Technology:** Use `lightweight-charts-python` or equivalent Python wrapper for TradingView charts embedded in Flask frontend.
- **Smooth UI:** Ensure animations and transitions for chart updates and watchlist changes.

---

### 7. **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:** Efficient batch downloads and database writes; responsive UI updates.
- **Reliability:** Robust error handling, retries, and checkpointing for uninterrupted data downloads.
- **Security:** Secure API keys, sanitize inputs, and protect database access.
- **Maintainability:** Modular codebase with clear separation of backend, frontend, and data layers.
- **Scalability:** Design database and API to handle growing data volumes and user watchlists.

---

### 8. **Development and Deployment Notes**

- Use Python Flask for backend REST API and business logic.
- Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for frontend styling and UI components.
- SQLite as lightweight embedded database, suitable for local or small-scale deployments.
- Use OpenAlgo Python client for data fetching; no CSV intermediate files.
- Integrate TradingView lightweight charts via Python wrappers for seamless embedding.
- Provide clear and user-friendly UI feedback during operations.

---

### 9. **Summary**

This PRD defines a fully integrated stock market data management tool that:

- Downloads and updates historical stock data directly into SQLite without CSV files.
- Maintains a dynamic, persistent watchlist with real-time quotes.
- Provides rich, interactive TradingView-style charts supporting multiple timeframes and real-time updates.
- Offers a clean, responsive UI with Tailwind and DaisyUI.
- Is designed for extensibility, reliability, and ease of use.

I've successfully converted the Flask/Jinja2 Historify project into a modern FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend! Here's what I've created:

🏗️ Architecture Overview
Backend (FastAPI)
Port: 5001 (as requested)
Structure: Modular with /app/main.py, /routes/, /models/, /database/, /core/, /utils/
Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
API: RESTful with automatic OpenAPI docs at /docs
Scheduler: APScheduler for automated downloads
Environment: .env configuration with python-dotenv
Frontend (Next.js)
Port: 3000 (Next.js default)
Language: JavaScript only (.js/.jsx files, no TypeScript)
Styling: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
Components: Modular React components
State: React hooks and Context API ready
Routing: Next.js file-based routing
🚀 Key Features Converted
✅ All original functionality maintained:

Watchlist management with real-time quotes
Bulk data download/import/export
TradingView charts with technical indicators
Scheduler for automated downloads
Settings management
Dark/light theme toggle
✅ Modern improvements:

RESTful API with automatic documentation
Responsive design with mobile support
Toast notifications and loading states
Clean component architecture
Environment-based configuration
📦 Quick Start
Backend Setup:

cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
python app/main.py
Frontend Setup:

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
🔧 Configuration
The backend runs on localhost:5001 and frontend on localhost:3000. The Next.js config includes API proxying to route /api/* requests to the FastAPI backend.

📊 API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API docs:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:5001/docs
ReDoc: http://localhost:5001/redoc
🎨 UI/UX
The frontend maintains the original design system with:

Modern card-based layouts
Smooth animations and transitions
Responsive grid systems
Professional color schemes
Consistent spacing and typography
The conversion preserves all the original functionality while providing a modern, scalable architecture that's easier to maintain and extend. Both services can be developed independently while working together seamlessly!

cd backend && python -m venv venv
cd frontend && npm install
